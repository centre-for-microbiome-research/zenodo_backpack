# zenodo_backpack

ZenodoBackpack provides a robust, standardised and repeatable approach to
distributing and using backend databases that bioinformatic tools rely on. These
databases are usually tool-specific and are often large enough in size that they
cannot be uploaded as data to software repositories (e.g. PyPI imposes a limit
of ~50MB).

ZenodoBackpack uploads/downloads data to/from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org),
which means that each dataset is associated with a DOI. Additionally, it
encapsulates the uploaded data in a Zenodo Backpack format, which is really just
a `CONTENTS.json` file and compresses the data in `.tar.gz` format before
upload. The `CONTENTS.json` file includes md5sum values for each included file
for robust verification.

It contains two main methods, which can be accessed through the
`zenodo_backpack` script or accessed as a software library:

**create**: turns a target directory into a zenodo_backpack-formatted .tar.gz archive with relevant checksum and version information, ready to be uploaded to Zenodo. It is necessary to provide a data version when doing so - furthermore, when uploading this backpack to zenodo.org, the version specified on the website **must** match that provided when the ZenodoBackpack was created. This allows version tracking and version validation of the data contained within the ZenodoBackpack. 
     
**download_and_extract**: takes a DOI string to download, extract and verify a zenodo_backpack archive from Zenodo.org to target directory. This returns a ZenodoBackpack object that can be queried for information. 
    

# Usage

## Command line
You can run zenodo_backpack as a stand-alone program, or import its classes and use them in source code. 

In command line, zenodo_backpack can create an archive to be uploaded to Zenodo: 

```
zenodo_backpack create --input_directory <./INPUT_DIRECTORY> --data_version <VERSION> --output_file <./ARCHIVE.tar.gz>
```

**NOTE**: it is important that when entering metadata on Zenodo, the version specified **MUST** match that supplied with --data_version

An uploaded existing zenodo_backpack can be downloaded (--bar if a graphical progress bar is desired) and unpacked as follows: 

```
zenodo_backpack download --doi <MY.DOI/111> --output_directory <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY> --bar
```

## API Usage

You can also import zenodo_backpack as a module: 

```
import zenodo_backpack
```

Backpacks can be created, downloaded and acquired from a local store:

### Create a backpack

Create a new backpack in `.tar.gz` format containing the payload data folder:
```
creator = zenodo_backpack.ZenodoBackpackCreator()
creator.create("/path/to/payload_directory", "path/to/archive.tar.gz", "0.1")
```

### Download a backpack

Download a backpack from Zenodo, defined by the DOI. The version is optional, and if not provided, the latest version will be downloaded.:
```
backpack_downloader = zenodo_backpack.ZenodoBackpackDownloader()
backpack = backpack_downloader.download_and_extract('/path/to/download_directory', 'MY.DOI/111111', version='MY.VERSION')
```

### Read a backpack that is already downloaded

Defined by a path
```
backpack = zenodo_backpack.acquire(path='/path/to/zenodobackpack/', md5sum=True)
```
or by environment variable
```
backpack = zenodo_backpack.acquire(env_var_name='MY_PROGRAM_DB', version="1.5.2")
```

### Working with a backpack

The `ZenodoBackpack` object returned by `acquire` and `download_and_extract` has instance methods to get at the downloaded data. For example, it can return the path to the payload directory within the `ZenodoBackpack` containing all the payload data:

```
useful_data_path = zenodo_backpack.acquire(env_var_name='MyZenodoBackpack', version="1.5.2").payload_directory_string()
```

# Installation

zenodo_backpack can be installed from pypi:

```
pip install zenodo-backpack
```

The easiest way to install is using conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge zenodo_backpack
```

Alternatively, you can git clone the repository and either run the bin/zenodo_backpack executable or install it with setup tools using 

```
python setup.py install
```

zenodo_backpack relies on **requests** and **tqdm** to display an optional graphical progress bar.
